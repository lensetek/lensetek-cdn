    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: 12 June 2025</div>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use the
      <strong>Lensetek AI Mate</strong> website and mobile application (the “Service”). By using the Service,
      you agree to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account and identity data</strong>: name, email address, profile photo (if you choose to link/sign in with Google or another provider).</li>
      <li><strong>Content you submit</strong>: text, images, prompts, and conversation context you provide for our AI features to process.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical data</strong>: IP address, device type, operating system, browser, device/installation identifiers, error logs, and diagnostics to maintain performance and security.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong>: feature interactions, access times, preferences you choose, and aggregate metrics to improve the product.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional device permissions</strong> (only if you enable them): camera/microphone for input, local storage for saving/exporting files, notifications, and approximate location when a feature requires it.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies & similar technologies</strong>: essential cookies for authentication and security; analytics cookies/SDKs to understand aggregate usage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the Service, including processing AI requests and syncing the web and app experience.</li>
      <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, spam, or harmful activity.</li>
      <li>Deliver customer support and service-related updates.</li>
      <li>Analyze and improve product performance (using aggregated and de-identified data where possible).</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce terms of use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cloud and security providers</strong> for hosting, backups, and attack mitigation.</li>
      <li><strong>Authentication providers</strong> (e.g., Google) if you choose that sign-in method.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics/performance providers</strong> for aggregate statistics and performance monitoring.</li>
      <li><strong>AI providers</strong> that process your inputs to generate responses (e.g., Google Gemini). We do not use your data to train our own models; data sent to providers is subject to their policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Law enforcement or others</strong> when required by law or to protect rights, safety, and compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes described or as required by law. Technical logs are retained for limited periods based on operational and security needs.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures such as encryption in transit (HTTPS), access controls, and monitoring to protect data. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; some residual risk may remain.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Request access to, correction, update, or deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>Decline or withdraw consent for specific permission-based processing (e.g., camera, microphone, location, notifications).</li>
      <li>Disable non-essential cookies via browser/device settings.</li>
      <li>Unsubscribe from marketing communications via the provided links or by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your region). We do not knowingly collect data from children under those requirements.</p>

    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data may be processed in countries where we or our service providers operate. We take reasonable steps to ensure equivalent protection in line with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>9. Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use essential cookies for security and login. Analytics cookies/SDKs are used only for aggregate statistics. You can manage cookies via browser settings; disabling essential cookies may affect basic functions.</p>

    <h2>10. Device Permissions (Web & Mobile)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera/Microphone</strong>: only when you choose to record or upload content.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage/Photos</strong>: to save outputs or pick files you want to send.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications</strong>: for alerts or updates you opt into.</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate location</strong>: only if a feature requires it and after you grant permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the app, website, or email. The “Last updated” date reflects the most recent change.</p>
